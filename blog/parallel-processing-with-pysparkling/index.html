            <p><code>pysparkling</code> is a pure Python implementation of Apache Spark's RDD interface.
It means you can do <code>pip install pysparkling</code> and start running Spark code in
Python. Its main use is in low latency applications where Spark operations
are applied to small datasets. However, <code>pysparkling</code> also supports the
parallelization of <code>map</code> operations through <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>ipcluster</code> and
<code>futures.concurrent</code>. This feature is still in development, but this post
explores what is already possible. Bottlenecks that were found while
writing this post are now included in version 0.3.10.</p>
<h2>Benchmark</h2>
<p>I wanted to measure a CPU-bound benchmark to see the overhead of object
serialization in comparison to actual computations. The benchmark function
is a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the number <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>. It generates
two uniformly distributed random numbers x and y each between 0 and 1 and
checks whether <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1\)</span>. The fraction of tries that satisfy this
condition approximates <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>/4.</p>
<p>To understand the process better, I instrumented the job execution with timers.
The cumulative time spent in parts like data deserialization on the worker
nodes and a few more are aggregated in the <code>Context._stats</code> variable.</p>
<p>A few problems became apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function that is applied in a map operation is the same for all
  partitions of the dataset. In the previous implementation, this function
  was serialized separately for every chunk of the data.</li>
<li>Through a nested dependency, all partitions of the data were sent to all
  the workers. Now only the partition that a given worker processes is sent to it.</li>
<li>Another slowdown was that core pysparkling functions were not pickle-able.
  That is not a problem for <code>cloudpickle</code>, but serializing and deserializing
  non-pickle-able functions takes longer. The <code>map()</code> and <code>wholeTextFiles()</code>
  methods have pickle-able helpers now.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The test was run on a 4-core Intel i5 processor and this is the result:</p>
<p><img class="image-process-crisp" src="/images/pysparkling_4cores.png" alt="Speedup with parallel processing on a 4-core Intel i5." /></p>
<p>Achieving a 3x improvement with four cores is good in real world benchmarks.
The new <code>Context._stats</code> variable gives more insight into where time is
actually spent. The numbers below are normalized with respect to the time
spent in the execution of the map function. The results for this CPU bound
benchmark with four processes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>map exec: 100.0%</li>
<li>driver deserialize data: 0.0%</li>
<li>map cache init: 0.2%</li>
<li>map deserialize data: 0.0%</li>
<li>map deserialize function: 2.1%</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time is spent in the actual map where it should be. The time it
takes to deserialize the map function is 2.1% of the time it takes to execute
it. The benchmark itself is run as a unit test in
<a href="https://github.com/svenkreiss/pysparkling/blob/master/tests/test_multiprocessing.py#L136">tests/test_multiprocessing.py</a>
and the plots can be recreated with <code>ipython tests/multiprocessing_performance_plot.py</code>.</p>
<p>The test was also run on a 4-core Intel i7 processor with Hyperthreading. You
can see that the performance is slightly better than with the i5, but that the
doubled threads do not double the performance.</p>

<p>As a first pass at multiprocessing with pysparkling, this is a good result.
Please check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/svenkreiss/pysparkling">Github</a>,
install it with <code>pip install pysparkling</code> and send feedback.</p>
