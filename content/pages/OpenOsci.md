> Open source and open hardware electronics project to build a low-cost digital oscilloscope with an 8-bit microcontroller and a mobile phone screen.

## Capabilities
* 4 input channels
* no fixed frequencies; the ADC can be run with different clock cycles and then the time for one x-division is displayed in the display; the "td" value (in the images below, 47 microseconds and 9 milliseconds)
* the display also shows a frequency estimate of the signal. The algorithm looks at the time between to successive crossings of the x-axis and calculates a frequency from that. For sine waves, this is reasonably accurate. In the right picture below I measure background noise with a frequency of 49 Hz; the left picture shows a 43 kHz oscillation.

Please be aware that I built only one version. There are many flaws in that one version, but all photos/videos shown here are made with this version.

* Board: [openosci_060306_produced.brd](/files/openosci/sketchy_060306_produced.brd)

While playing around with this prototype, I was already making improvements to layout and board which I never built or tested.

This is an old project of mine. It was done in 2006 and some parts might be out of date. I cannot guaranty proper functionality or fitness for any particular use.
