Summary: Finished my PhD thesis: Higgs Boson Discovery and First Property Measurements using the ATLAS Detector. It summarizes my work over a few years on Higgs Physics with ATLAS and on collaborative statistical modeling.
Status: published


Last May, I finished my PhD in Particle Physics. I had a great time studying physics and doing research at some of the best places: the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, for my bachelor's and master's degrees and New York University for my PhD including a year at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. I also had great advisors: [Tilman Plehn](http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~plehn/), [Thomas Gregoire](http://www.physics.carleton.ca/people/faculty-members/thomas-gregoire) and [Kyle Cranmer](http://theoryandpractice.org/).

For my PhD, I was working on the discovery of the Higgs boson. CERN was an amazing place during that time, with the best particle physicists from all over the world working together. I made substantial contributions to the discovery in the [ATLAS collaboration](http://atlas.ch/). I was the first person to combine two search channels and to see the 5Ïƒ discovery threshold being breached ([blog post on the New York Times article](/blog/chasing-the-higgs-nyt/)). I created the plot on the right that was published in the [ATLAS discovery paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X), [Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/338/6114/1576.full.pdf) and many other places. I also worked on measuring the Higgs boson mass and the coupling strengths to other particles. A large part of my time was dedicated to statistical modeling and the development of analysis tools, some of which are now part of [CERN's ROOT data analysis tool](https://root.cern.ch) and its statistics extension [RooStats](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/RooStats/WebHome).
