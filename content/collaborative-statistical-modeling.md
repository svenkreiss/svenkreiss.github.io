Summary: A poster about the collaborative statistical modeling work that Kyle Cranmer and I did and that was used to discover the Higgs boson. We presented this at the opening of the Center for Data Science at NYU.
Status: published

This poster was created by [Kyle Cranmer](http://theoryandpractice.org/) and me.
It is about the tools we built and were part of the discovery of the Higgs
boson. It’s from a while ago, but it needs more exposure as the work behind it
is applicable outside of physics, but largely unknown.

The Higgs group of the ATLAS experiment (one of the two large experiments at
CERN) has a few hundred members working in seven subgroups. The final
statistical test to claim the discovery is done with a combined statistical
model with input models from all subgroups, and in addition models from detector
performance groups and theoretical models from outside the Higgs group. It is
based on statistical methods and technical innovation that deserves more
attention. Outside of particle physics, this is a topic that is gaining
interest, but people are unaware of the experience and technology in
particle physics.

The important part is the separation of model and method. The way collaborative
statistical modeling works at ATLAS is that it is really just the way how
models are built, investigated and debugged. The methods (inference,
generation, confidence intervals, credibility intervals, posterior
probabilities, hypothesis tests, ...) are done by tools that take a model as
input. Any method — no matter whether Frequentist or Bayesian — can be applied
to any model.
