Two years ago, I returned from New York City to Geneva. I had left my
industry job and returned to academia as a postdoc in Computer Vision at
EPFL. It has been an exciting two years for me in Alexandre Alahi's lab
for [Visual Intelligence for Transportation](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/).
When entering academia from industry, I had no research
or publication momentum. As a starting point,
I tried to make connections to my previous work in physics,
particularly in statistical and physical modeling.
This led me to focus on _Composite Fields_ for human pose estimation.


## Past

In an extremely short time, we have created three
exciting projects with interesting scientific contributions and state-of-the-art
results on challenging tasks like Human Pose Estimation. These papers were
presented at ICRA, CVPR and ICCV which are the top-tier conferences
in robotics and computer vision.

* __Crowd-Robot Interaction__: Crowd-aware Robot Navigation with Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning.<br />
  Presented at ICRA2019 in Montreal. Lead by Changan Chan and Yuejiang Liu.<br />

* __PifPaf__: Composite Fields for Human Pose Estimation.<br />
  Presented at CVPR2019 in Los Angeles.<br />

  <span style="white-space: nowrap">[<i class="fa fa-github"></i> code](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf)</span>
* __MonoLoco__: Monocular 3D Pedestrian Localization and Uncertainty Estimation.<br />
  Presented at ICCV2019 in Seoul. Lead by Lorenzo Bertoni.<br />

I also presented an overview of our
work at the Autonomous Driving workshop at ICML2019 in Los Angeles, at KAIST
in South Korea as well as at the European and Swiss transportation
conferences hEART (Budapest) and STRC (Ascona).

[PifPaf](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf) has also created interest in
industry. Setting up a commercialization
pipeline with EPFL's Technology Transfer Office was another exciting first.

At EPFL, it is also possible to gain professor-style teaching experience
as a postdoc through co-teaching. We are currently co-teaching for the second time
_Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles_ to master students. Last semester, we
gave an introductory course in machine learning tailored for engineering students
in the bachelor program.


## Current

I have three papers under review that extend my
previous work in human pose estimation and joint work on pedestrian localization and metric learning. All of these are very exciting and I am looking forward to share more soon.

Another new process for me was applying for grants. I successfully obtained
a _Spark Grant_ from the Swiss National Science Foundation for the
development of _Deep Social Force_ that pays for the project for one year -- my
first time being a PI on a grant.
I also drafted our lab's contribution to the
[EPFL Interdisciplinary Seed Fund](https://www.epfl.ch/research/services/fund-research/funding-opportunities/research-funding/interdisciplinary-seed-fund/isf-granted-projects/)
project to use
_Artificial Intelligence for understanding and overcoming motor deficits_
in collaboration with two labs at the hospital in Lausanne
that work on Parkinson and Spinal Cord Injury.

After two years back in academia, I am still not bored. Not at all.
__Thanks VITA team!__ Onwards.
