Summary: An $\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon$ Pelican plugin to render math in JavaScript libraries like KaTeX.
Status: draft


The new plugin is $\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon$, particularly
in combination with KaTeX as on this blog. It has good support for big
equations: $$E=mc^2$$
A vector $\vec{a}$ looks beautiful. Writing
order of magnitudes with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is pretty. There was a related
[Pelican issue](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/issues/625)
for support.
