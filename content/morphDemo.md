[This](/files/morphDemo.html) is an interactive demo for a new morphing algorithm with special properties that are motivated from Physics. It uses KD trees and kernel density estimates that are calculated in real time in this demo. All visualization is done using `d3.js` and custom code for KD trees and kernel densities in JavaScript.
